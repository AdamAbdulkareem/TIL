## 🔍 Topic
Understanding how the `flex-grow` and `flex-basis` values influence flex item sizing, especially when using shorthand like `flex: 1 1 auto` vs `flex: 1 1 0`.

---

## 💡 Key Insight

- `flex: 1 1 auto` distributes space **based on content size**.
  - Each item **grows equally**, but the **initial content size** matters.
  - Items with more content will appear **larger**, even with the same flex-grow factor.

- `flex: 1 1 0` distributes space **equally**, ignoring content size.
  - All items **start at 0** width.
  - Since all have the same grow factor, they **expand equally**.
  - Result: **Equal-width** flex items regardless of content.

## 🔍 Topic
How `flex-shrink` interacts with item content size and container width, and what happens when shrinking is disallowed.

---

## 💡 Key Insight

- `flex-shrink: 1` (default) allows items to shrink proportionally when the flex container is too narrow.
- Shrinking is based on the **flex base size** (usually content width), and **never goes below the min-content size** of an item.
- `flex-shrink: 0` disables shrinking completely.
  - ❗ If the total width of the items exceeds the container, **horizontal overflow occurs**.

### Base Size (from `flex-basis`)
- `flex-basis: auto` + `width` set → use `width`
- `flex-basis: auto` + no `width` → use content size
- `flex-basis: 0` → ignore content size (start from 0)
- `flex-basis: [value]` → use given size (floored at min-content)

### Space Conditions
- **Extra space** → `flex-grow` distributes it
- **Overflow** → `flex-shrink` reduces size (not below min-content)

### Don't Want Items to Resize?
- Use `justify-content` for spacing (e.g., `space-between`)
- Use `margin: auto` on flex items for dynamic gaps
